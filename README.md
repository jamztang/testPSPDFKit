Testing custom cocoapods integration for PSPDFKit. There were some issues when running PSPDFKit on M1 device.

There're mainly three status:

1. failed to import
2. no license
3. success


![1](/images/failedtoimport)
![2](/images/nolicense)
![3](/images/success)

In my testing, after I filled in the license when running on an M1 device simulator, it properly shows success state
